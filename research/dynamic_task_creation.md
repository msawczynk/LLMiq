# Research on Dynamic Task Creation for LLM Memory and Context Management

## Overview
Dynamic task creation involves generating or adapting tasks in real-time based on previous interactions, user inputs, or model performance. This is useful for testing LLMs' memory retention and context handling, revealing issues like context drift or catastrophic forgetting.

## Key Concepts
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Adapt tasks on-the-fly, e.g., generate follow-ups based on prior responses.
- **Memory Management**: Use external stores or summarization to handle long contexts.
- **Context Management**: Test retrieval in multi-turn interactions with branching logic.

## Relevant Libraries
- **LangChain**: For building adaptive chains and memory modules (Trust Score: 9.8).
- **LlamaIndex**: For RAG-based retrieval and dynamic querying (Trust Score: 9.5).
- **Haystack**: For NLP pipelines with dynamic prompting (Trust Score: 9.2).
- **Benchmarks**: LongBench and BigBench for testing long-context and memory tasks.

## Insights
- Studies show LLMs struggle with middle-context information.
- Best Practices: Scale contexts dynamically, measure recall and hallucinations.

This research informs enhancements to the LLMiq test for more robust evaluation.
