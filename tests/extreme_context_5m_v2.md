# Extreme Context 5M Test V2 (Direct Prompt)

## Instructions
V2: Randomized queries in 2M-item simulation.

## Prompt

1. Simulate 2M-item list. State random positions (e.g., 1234567th).

2. Scale to 4M virtually, add paradoxes at multiple points. Query random extreme position.

3. Coding task paradoxes on virtual scale.

4. Score; estimate as simulated length * 2.5 tokens.

## Review
- Randomized for robustness.
